# Membership

**Membership Principles**
1. **Financial stake**: The consortium wishes that each member recurrently contributes financially to the consortium, with the goal of covering costs for collective purposes, such as meetups and others. The contribution amount from each member should be flexible to their financial situation, but we suggest a default contribution amount as a baseline.
2. **Trust**: The consortium aims to have a high trust level in the group by seeing each other as individuals as part of contexts. This is achieved by maintaining regular communication, distributing care labour and being mindful of hierarchies that may arise.
3. **European**: be related to European activities.
4. **Active participation**: as a member one actively takes part in the practices that have been agreed upon by the consortium.

**Membership criteria**
1. Pay a monthly membership fee, flexible for each member, with a suggested baseline of 10€ (which can be paid in advance for up to 12 months). See financial stake.
2. Be actively vouched for by at least 3 active members: A vouch should be initiated by another active member and can later be removed at any time. (see “Membership Split” for limit cases)
3. Have physical or legal presence in Europe, or be involved in an active consortium project with at least one member with a physical or legal presence in Europe
4. Be a natural person.
5. If not a member for the last 12 months:
    1. Publicly introduced themselves to the existing members (ex: background, motivation, skills, etc.)
6. If a member for the last 12 months: 
    1. Voted in the last annual general assembly
    2. Have volunteered in the last 12 months on tasks required to keep the consortium running and reported those contributions
    3. Have attended at least 1 of the last 3 physical gatherings.

If a member fails to maintain their active status by omitting to fulfill some of the criteria above, they become an “Inactive Member” for up to a year, and lose voting rights. An active member will contact them to understand why. The “Inactive Member” can then choose to: (1) fulfill the criteria to become “Active” again, or (2) become a “Past Member”. In the absence of answer, after one year of “Inactive” status, they automatically become “Past Members”. (see “Recognizing Past Members” below)

### Vouching Functions

Vouching serves two functions: 
  1. enable active members to invite a new person to become a member of the consortium  
  2. sharing ongoing appreciation and responsibility for the impact of the vouchee on the rest of the consortium after.
  
When inviting a new member in the consortium, the voucher should ensure that their presence will improve the strengh of the consortium. Voucher are therefore encouraged to assess whether the new member has compatible values, relevant skills, and has sufficient motivation to actively contribute. One way to assess all three at the same time is to review past contributions to the larger SSB project: e.g. tools built with or for SSB, artwork created, volunteering in maintaining the code base or helping with community gardening, etc. Other ways of assessing the member are of course also possible and are left to the discretion of the voucher. 

After a new member has been accepted in the consortium, vouchers now share an ongoing responsibility towards the impact of that member on the consortium. This has both positive and negative implications. On the positive side, additional existing members may also decide to vouch for the new member: the more vouchers a member gets, the stronger others would like them to stay. The real weight of vouching however manifests when conflicts arise: vouchers then have a responsibility to help defuse and mediate conflicts, if the vouchee cannot or would not resolve them alone. If a voucher cannot or would not hold that responsibility, they should remove their vouching. In effect, vouching means: "I appreciate this person's contributions enough that I am willing to share the emotional burden of ensuring they can keep participating".

### Membership Split

Some members may stop vouching other members such that membership would split into disjoint groups (often two of them). If one of these groups is larger than all others, that group becomes the official consortium. If not, e.g. when it splits into two groups of the same size, the consortium is dissolved and its assets are liquidated and transferred to the Secure Scuttlebutt Consortium Open Collective.

The other disjoint groups shall create new consortiums with different names.

### Recognizing Past Members

Recognition is based on mutual consent:
  1. Active members are encouraged, but not obliged, to list “Past Members” and a summary of their contributions on the consortium’s public website for posterity.
  2. “Past Members” have the possibility, but no obligation, to be listed publicly on the consortium website. Their active consent will be sought by active members that want to recognize them, unless the past members are not able to give that consent anymore. In the latter case, the choice of listing or not the “Past Member” is left to the best judgement of the active members.
